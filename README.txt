== Description ==
Neshan™ Maps Platform provides several map based services to developers. This plugin is a tool to make it easier for site owners or developers to create maps. You need an API Key which you can get one for free from https://developer.neshan.org.
Please keep in mind that this plugin should load some external resources (Neshan Web SDK files) from static.neshan.org. These files are:
* Main Neshan Web SDK javascript file (v4.6.5.js)
* Main Neshan Web SDK stylesheet file (v4.6.5.css)
Also there is a javascript file which is load externally for old environments like Internet Explorer and Android 4.x browsers. Because this file generated based on user\'s browser compatibilities, there is no chance to prevent offloading it:
